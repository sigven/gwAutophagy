The results and data obtained from this genome-wide screen in yeast are provided <i>as is</i> for research and informational purposes only. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and reliability, the authors and their affiliated institutions cannot guarantee that the data is free from errors or omissions. Users are encouraged to interpret and use this data considering its limitations.

<h6><b>Data Accuracy and Limitations</b></h6>
<span>The genome-wide screen may have limitations, including but not limited to false positives, false negatives, incomplete data, and errors introduced during sample handling, data collection, and analysis processes. False positives may also arise due the compact nature of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, where deletion of an ORF can affect expression of nearby ORFs. Two examples in the AutoDRY dataset are YMR158W-B, which is a dubious ORF that overlaps the known autophagy gene YMR159C/ATG16; and YNR005C, a dubious ORF that overlaps YNR006W/VPS27, which functions in transport to the vacuole. It also cannot be excluded that certain gene deletions affect expression of ORFs in trans depending on the 3D organization of the genome. Autophagy also strongly depends on growth conditions of the yeast strains, and users should carefully optimize growth conditions of the strains (see <a href='#citation'>Chica et al.</a>).
Therefore, users are encouraged to conduct additional experiments and validations, including targeted disruption of the ORF of interest, evaluate growth conditions, and treat this data as a resource for generating hypotheses rather than definitive proof.</span>
