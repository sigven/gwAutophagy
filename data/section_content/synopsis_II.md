While the autophagy field has provided detailed insights into core molecular regulatory pathways, a lack of systems-level data on autophagy control and dynamics has constrained the development of predictive models and <i>in vivo</i> manipulation strategies. Answering these questions requires a comprehensive understanding of genome-wide influences on autophagy dynamics, beyond basic on-off mechanisms.
